# Golden Gate Estate - Data Science Project

Welcome to the Golden Gate Estate Data Science project repository! In this repository, you will find a comprehensive guide to our data analysis and modeling process, following the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology.

## Project Overview
We have created a Jupyter Notebook, named `Ai_Workshop2.ipynb`, that takes you through our journey of understanding, analyzing, and modeling data for a fictional company, Golden Gate Estate. The primary objective of this project is to predict house prices within the estate.

## Models Built
Our analysis and modeling process involved the development of both a classifier and a regression model. These models were constructed using state-of-the-art data science techniques to ensure accurate predictions and insights.

## Streamlit App Deployment
To make our models accessible and user-friendly, we have deployed them in a Streamlit web application. You can interact with the deployed models by visiting the following link: [Golden Gate Estate App](AppLink).

This repository is designed to provide a transparent and replicable view of our data science project for the Golden Gate Estate. We hope it serves as a valuable resource for anyone interested in data analysis, modeling, or the CRISP-DM process.

Happy exploring!
